# Hacking my AlarmÂ System

Some time ago I bought this, "Kit Casa Segura", a Alarm System for home security based on a center unit that communicates with an app via Wifi 2.4Ghz and peripherals like sensors and remote controllers operating at 433Mhz frquency.

As I got into SDR, RF and Signal Inteligence, I doubted if I could hack, reverse engenieer or even improve this product (thought of adding a Wifi Deauth detector as an sensor and mitigate or detect jamming?). 

This is the repository in which I plan to store IQ files and documentation of the project.
